<h1> Naveen's GOAT movies</h1>
<h2> Here are three movies I particularly like</h2>
<hr /> 

<h3>Super Deluxe (Tamil)</h3>
<p> Just an amazing movie overall - very existential </p>

<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p> Still don't quite know what it means, but it's amazing</p>

<h3>Sucession</h3>
<p>Not a TV show, but amazing nonetheless </p>
